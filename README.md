Contributing
------------

To build and run the tests, you need Java 8 or later and Maven 3 or later. Simply clone and run `mvn install`

Note that the tests run the plugin against a number of sample test projects, located in the `test-projects` folder.
If adding new functionality, or fixing a bug, it is recommended that a sample project be set up so that the scenario
can be tested end-to-end.

See also [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on deploying to Nexus and releasing the plugin.
